* i or install => Loads the "manyp-ag" files and directories over the current directory.

* u or update => Update all files and packages from "manyp-ag".

* s or start => It makes our project aware of the changes to automatically execute the corresponding commands. In the development phase, the project must always be attentive to changes.

* -h or help => This help message.
